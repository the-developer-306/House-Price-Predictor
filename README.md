## Introduction

  House Price Predictor utilizes machine learning to predict housing prices in Boston. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to provide reliable price predictions.

## Features

  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Price prediction

## Installation

  Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/the-developer-306/House-Price-Predictor.git
  cd House-Price-Predictor
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

  1. **Prepare the data**: Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly. Use the provided dataset or your own.
  2. **Open and run the following notebooks in Jupyter**: 
	
	
  - DRAGON REAL ESTATES (House Price Predictor).ipynb
  - Making Price Predictions for DRAGON REAL ESTATES.ipynb

## Model

The project employs several regression algorithms to predict house prices. The models explored include:

- **Linear Regression**: A basic approach to model the relationship between input features and the target variable.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.

Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
